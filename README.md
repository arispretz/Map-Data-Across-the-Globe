# Map-Data-Across-the-Globe

This is one of my projects in the way to achieve "Legacy Data Visualization" certification at freeCodeCamp.org. It was designed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, d3js and Sass.

User Story: I can see where all Meteorites landed on a world map.

User Story: I can tell the relative size of the meteorite, just by looking at the way it's represented on the map.

User Story: I can mouse over the meteorite's data point for additional data.

Hint: Here's a dataset you can use to build this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/meteorite-strike-data.json
